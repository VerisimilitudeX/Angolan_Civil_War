      <h1>Angolan Civil War (1975–2002)</h1>
      <p>The Angolan Civil War was a major armed conflict emerging soon after Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975. It involved multiple factions and outside influences, ultimately shaping modern Angola's political and social landscape.</p>

    <p>
      The Angolan Civil War was rooted in the power struggle between different
      liberation movements that had fought Portuguese colonial rule. Over the decades, it
      drew involvement from international actors such as the Soviet Union, Cuba, the United
      States, and South Africa. The conflict officially concluded in 2002 after decades of
      turmoil, leaving Angola with significant reconstruction challenges.
